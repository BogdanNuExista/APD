Analysis of Matrix Multiplication Algorithm Implementations for N=1000:

1. Analysis of Serial Implementations (ijk permutations)
-> Performance Rankings (from fastest to slowest):
    IKJ: 2.827s
    KIJ: 2.903s
    JIK: 3.346s
    IJK: 4.319s
    KJI: 11.999s
    JKI: 12.441s

-> Key Observations:
    -> Cache Efficiency Impact:
        IKJ and KIJ variants significantly outperform others (2.8-2.9s)
        They are roughly 4x faster than the slowest variants (JKI, KJI)
        This superior performance is due to better cache utilization through
    -> Memory Access Patterns:
        The worst performers (JKI and KJI) suffer from poor spatial locality
        These variants access matrix elements in a non-sequential pattern, causing frequent cache misses
        The difference between best and worst is approximately 4.4x (2.827s vs 12.441s)
    -> Classical Algorithm (IJK):
        Performs moderately well but not optimally (4.319s)
        About 1.5x slower than the best variant (IKJ)
        Shows why optimization of loop ordering is important

2. Analysis of Parallel Implementations (8 threads, ijk permutations)
-> Performance Rankings (from fastest to slowest):
    IKJ: 0.718s
    JIK: 1.517s
    IJK: 1.536s
    KIJ: 1.680s
    JKI: 3.057s
    KJI: 3.988s

-> Key Observations:
    -> Speedup Analysis:
        Best parallel implementation (IKJ): 3.94x speedup over its serial version
        Classical algorithm (IJK): 2.81x speedup
        Worst case (KJI): 3.01x speedup

    -> Scaling Efficiency:
        With 8 threads, none achieved perfect 8x speedup
        Best efficiency: IKJ at 49.2% (3.94/8)
        Suggests memory bandwidth limitations are a significant factor

    -> Pattern Consistency:
        IKJ remains the best performer in both serial and parallel versions
        JKI and KJI remain the worst performers
        Cache effects continue to dominate even in parallel execution

3. Blocked Algorithm Analysis
-> Performance Across Block Sizes:
    Block Size | Serial Time | Parallel Time | Speedup
    ----------------------------------------------
    16         | 2.655s     | 0.790s        | 3.36x
    32         | 2.506s     | 0.723s        | 3.47x
    64         | 2.578s     | 0.771s        | 3.34x
    128        | 2.658s     | 0.673s        | 3.95x

-> Key Observations:

    -> Block Size Impact:
        - Best serial performance: 32 blocks (2.506s)
        - Best parallel performance: 128 blocks (0.673s)
        - Performance differences between block sizes are relatively small (≈5-15%)

    -> Comparison with Non-blocked Versions:
        - Blocked algorithm outperforms classical IJK (2.506s vs 4.319s)
        - Parallel blocked version competitive with best parallel version (0.673s vs 0.718s)
        - Shows effectiveness of blocking for cache utilization

    -> Cache Considerations:
        - 32-64 block sizes work well with typical L1 cache sizes
        - Larger blocks (128) work better in parallel due to reduced synchronization overhead
        - A good block size for my compoter would be 128, as it achieves the best performance

4. Overall Conclusions and Recommendations

    -> Best Algorithms:
        - For serial execution: Use IKJ variant
        - For parallel execution: Use either IKJ variant or blocked algorithm with 128 block size
        - Both achieve similar performance (≈0.7s)

    -> Performance Optimization Guidelines:
        - Prioritize cache-friendly memory access patterns
        - Consider using blocked algorithm for large matrices
        - Choose block sizes based on target architecture's cache size

    -> Scalability Considerations:
        - Memory bandwidth is the main limiting factor for parallel speedup
        - Consider NUMA-aware implementations for larger systems
        - Further optimization might require architecture-specific tuning

    -> Future Optimization Possibilities:
        - Explore vector instructions (SIMD)
        - Implement hybrid approaches combining blocking with optimal loop ordering
        - Consider autotuning block sizes based on matrix and cache sizes
